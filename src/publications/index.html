        The geometry of the multifractional Brownian motion (mBm) is known to present a complex and surprising form when the Hurst function is greatly irregular. Nevertheless, most of the literature devoted to the subject considers sufficiently smooth cases which lead to sample paths locally similar to a fractional Brownian motion (fBm). The main goal of this paper is therefore to extend these results to a more general frame and consider any type of continuous Hurst function. More specifically, we mainly focus on obtaining a complete characterization of the pointwise Hölder regularity of the sample paths, and the Box and Hausdorff dimensions of the graph. These results, which are somehow unusual for a Gaussian process, are illustrated by several examples, presenting in this way different aspects of the geometry of the mBm with irregular Hurst functions.

        In this work, we investigate the fine regularity of Lévy processes using the 2-microlocal formalism. This framework allows us to refine the multifractal spectrum determined by Jaffard and, in addition, study the oscillating singularities of Lévy processes. The fractal structure of the latter is proved to be more complex than the classic multifractal spectrum and is determined in the case of alpha-stable processes. As a consequence of these fine results and the properties of the 2-microlocal frontier, we are also able to completely characterise the multifractal nature of the linear fractional stable motion (extension of fractional Brownian motion to \(\alpha\)-stable measures) in the case of continuous and unbounded sample paths as well. The regularity of its multifractional extension is also presented, indirectly providing an example of a stochastic process with a non-homogeneous and random multifractal spectrum.

        In this article is introduced and studied a set-indexed Markov property named \(\mathcal{C}\)-Markov. This new definition fulfils one important expectation for a Markov property: there exists a natural set-indexed generalization of the concept of transition operator which leads to characterization and construction theorems for \(\mathcal{C}\)-Markov processes. Several other usual Markovian notions, including Feller and strong Markov properties, can also be developed in this framework. Actually, the \(\mathcal{C}\)-Markov property turns out to be a natural extension of the two-parameter \(\ast\)-Markov property to the multiparameter and as well the set-indexed settings. Moreover, generalizing a classic result of the real-parameter Markov theory, sample paths of multiparameter \(\mathcal{C}\)-Feller processes are proved to be almost surely right-continuous. Concepts and results introduced in this study are illustrated with various examples.

        The purpose of this article is a set-indexed extension of the well-known Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. The first part is devoted to a stationary definition of the random field and ends up with the proof of a complete characterization by its \(L^2\)-continuity, stationarity and set-indexed Markov properties. This specific Markov transition system allows to define a general <em>set-indexed Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (SIOU) process</em> with any initial probability measure. Finally, in the multiparameter case, the SIOU process is proved to admit a natural integral representation.

        Recently, a new approach in the fine analysis of stochastic processes sample paths has been developed to predict the evolution of the local regularity under (pseudo-)differential operators. In this paper, we study the sample paths of continuous martingales and stochastic integrals. We proved that the almost sure 2-microlocal frontier of a martingale can be obtained through the local regularity of its quadratic variation. It allows to link the Hölder regularity of a stochastic integral to the regularity of the integrand and integrator processes. These results provide a methodology to predict the local regularity of diffusions from the fine analysis of its coefficients. We illustrate our work with examples of martingales with unusual complex regularity behaviour and square of Bessel processes.
