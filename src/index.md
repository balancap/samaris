### Who I am

I am presently a post-doc working in collaboration with professor [Leonid Mytnik](http://iew3.technion.ac.il/Home/Users/leonid.phtml) at the Israel Institute of Technology - Technion. My present research project investigates the (multi)fractal geometry of *continuous random trees* and measure-valued processes such as *Lévy super-Brownian motion*. I am happily working on these subjects thanks to a joined fellowship of the Technion and the [French Embassy in Israël](http://institutfrancais-israel.com).

From 2010 to 2013, I did my Ph.D. at the École Centrale Paris, in the MAS laboratory, under the supervision of professor [Erick Herbin](http://erick.perso.math.cnrs.fr). My thesis was primarily focused on the use of a (very!) analytical framework named *2-microlocal analysis* in probability theory, and investigate sample path properties of stochastic processes such as *multifractional Brownian motion* and *Lévy processes* in this frame. As the former was obviously not cumbersome enough, I happened to mix it with a bit of multifractal analysis to study nice classes of processes such *linear fractional stable motion*. For *epsilon* lovers and fans of fractional operators, you may find the full manuscript [here](https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-00958290/).

Before my short academic life, I obtained in 2010 a MSc degree in Probability and Statistics from University Paris XI - Orsay. I also graduated from the engineering school École Centrale Paris with a MSc in Applied Mathematics during the same year.

A full C.V. is also available [here](files/cv_research.pdf).

### What I enjoy working on

Probability theory • fractal geometry • local regularity • 2-microlocal analysis • multifractal analysis • (multi)fractional processes • continuous random trees • superprocesses
